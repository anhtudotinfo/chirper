# Chirper

## Twitter clone made with Django & Bootstrap (In progress)

### Developed by Salim Ege Caliskan

Chirper is a Twitter-clone that I made as a hobby project in order to practice Django and Bootstrap. It is going to be a blog where users can register, login and logout; make, edit and delete posts. All of the users who are logged in can see the posts that are made, but only the user who made the post can edit/delete it. Users can also visit other users profile to see what only that particular person has been posting.

I have recently reading Eric Matthes' *Python Crash Course*, and decided to take on a pet project of myself to put what I had learned into practice. I am practicing managing models, views and templates; and getting better at handling registrations, logins and logouts.
